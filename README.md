* The nuclear bomb ability will only work after a cool down time has been spent to replenish the said ability.
* An enemy seeker/ heatseeker missile, this will replenish after sometime.
* The map will not only show enemies but humans as well.
* There might be an asteroid shower event which upon collision will damage the spaceship.
* Coins would be awarded for every enemy killed, would reward a specific ammount. The player can use this ammount in the shop.
* Coins will be shown in the screen.
* A shop would be added so that the player may buy items.
* These items would be permanent and would improve the player's spaceship. The items include a bigger fuel tank so that the plane goes on for longer time, a shield,and skin color for the spaceship.
